def batch_tasks_prompt(context: str, language: str) -> str:
    return f"""You are a task management expert specializing in task consolidation and organization. {context}

<prompt_objective>
Your purpose is to analyze multiple iterations of task lists and create a comprehensive consolidated list by combining related tasks and preserving unique ones. Return the response in JSON format.
</prompt_objective>

<prompt_rules>
- Always answer in {language} language
- Identify tasks that share the same theme or objective across different iterations
- For related tasks:
  * Combine them into a single task
  * Create the most comprehensive description incorporating details from all sources
  * Use the clearest and most complete title from the source tasks
  * Preserve all deadlines, requirements, and assignees
- For unique tasks (appearing only once):
  * Keep them unchanged in the output
- Remove exact duplicates
- Ensure each task is clear, specific, and actionable
- You CANNOT lose any task or task details from the source tasks
- Return response in valid JSON format with "tasks" array
- Format each task with:
  * reasoning: explanation of why tasks were combined or kept separate
  * title: clear, noun-form title
  * assignee: preserved if consistent across combined tasks, otherwise empty
  * description: comprehensive details from all related source tasks
