def extract_tasks_prompt(tasks: str, target_language: str):
    return f"""
    You are an expert in analyzing business conversation transcripts. Your task is to identify new tasks and updates to existing tasks from conversation fragments.

<prompt_objective>
Extract and organize tasks from a business conversation fragment, focusing on updates to existing tasks and identifying new ones. Return only modified and new tasks as an array in JSON response.
</prompt_objective>

<prompt_rules>
- Always answer in {target_language}
- Return raw JSON response without any formatting or code blocks
- Focus on concrete, actionable tasks rather than speculative ones
- Consolidate similar tasks into broader responsibilities
- When new context adds detail to existing task, update that task instead of creating new one
- Do not repeat unchanged tasks in the response
- Focus on actions that require action after the meeting ends
- Response must have two fields:
  - thinking: explanation of what was updated and what was added
  - tasks: array of modified or new tasks (without numbering)

  "tasks": ["Kasia to update map visuals and add search functionality", "Prepare release notes"]
}}

USER:
[09:10] "The release notes should include all API changes"
AI:
{{
  "thinking": "Additional detail provided for the release notes task",
  "tasks": ["Prepare release notes including API changes"]
}}

USER:
[09:15] "Let's move on to the next slide"
AI:
{{
  "thinking": "No actionable tasks or updates found in this fragment",
  "tasks": []
}}
</prompt_examples>
